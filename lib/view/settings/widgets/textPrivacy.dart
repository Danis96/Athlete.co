      'We use the Firebase service from Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) in order to derive application behavioural analytics. We use that information to see how users interact with our website and app. Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers numerous services for developers. A list can be found here: https://firebase.google.com/terms/. Some Firebase services process personal data. In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called "instance IDs", which are provided with a time stamp. These "Instance IDs" assigned by Firebase are unique and thus allow the linking of different events or processes. This data does not represent personally identifiable information for us, nor do we make any efforts to personalize it subsequently. We process these aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior, for example by evaluating crash reports. Currently, we use the following Firebase services: \nGoogle Analytics for Firebase: Google Analytics uses the data to provide analytics and attribution information. The precise information collected can vary by the device and environment. You can find more information via this link: https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039. Google Analytics retains ID-associated data for 60 days, and retains aggregate reporting and campaign data without automatic expiration, unless the Firebase customer changes their retention preference in their Analytics settings or deletes their project. For Analytics for Firebase, Google uses not only the "Instance ID" described above, but also the advertising ID of the end device. You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device. For Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Reset Ad ID For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > No ad trackingF;irebase Remote Config: Remote Config uses Instance IDs to select configuration values to return to end-user devices. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.F;irebase Dynamic Links: Dynamic Links uses device specs on iOS to open newly-installed apps to a specific page or context. Dynamic Links only stores device specs temporarily, to provide the service.F;irebase Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to transmit push messages or so-called in-app messages (messages that are only displayed within the respective app). A pseudonymized push reference is assigned to the mobile device, which serves as a target for the push messages or in-app messages. The push messages can be deactivated and reactivated at any time in the settings of the mobile device. Firebase Cloud Messaging uses Instance IDs to determine which devices to deliver messages to. Firebase retains Instance IDs until the Firebase customer makes an API call to delete the ID. After the call, data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.F;irebase will use this information on our behalf for the above mentioned reasons.T;he legal basis for the use of this service is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f GDPR.
